# Kimai-Assignment

## Overview
Below are theree possible ways to deploy Kimai application in Docker container:
1. **Docker Compose** - Best for local or small deployments.
2. **AWS ECS (Fargate or EC2)** - Best for managed container deployment.
3. **Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted)** - Best for scaling and high availability.

---

## Option 1: Docker Compose (Best for local or small deployments)
### **Architecture**
- **Host Machine** (EC2 instance, VM, or bare metal server)
- **Docker Daemon** (Runs containers)
- **Docker Compose** (Orchestrates multi-container applications)
- **Kimai Container** (Application service)
- **database Container** (Database service)
- **Reverse Proxy (NGINX)** (Optional, for SSL and routing)

### **Pros**
- Easy to set up and manage.
- Suitable for small teams or internal use.
- Minimal overhead and straightforward debugging.

### **Cons**
- Lacks scalability and high availability.
- No built-in load balancing.

---

## Option 2: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
### **Architecture**
- **AWS ECS Cluster** (Managed container orchestration)
- **Fargate or EC2 launch type**
- **Kimai Task** (Containerized application)
- **database on RDS** (Managed database service)
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (For routing and SSL termination)

### **Pros**
- Fully managed by AWS, reducing operational overhead.
- Easier to scale compared to Docker Compose.

### **Cons**
- Limited flexibility compared to Kubernetes.
- More AWS dependency.

---

## Option 3: Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS, or Self-hosted)
### **Architecture**
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Managed via EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted)
- **Kimai Deployment** (Runs in pods)
- **RDS** (Database backend)
- **Persistent Volumes (EFS)** (For database storage)
- **Ingress Controller** (For traffic routing)

### **Pros**
- Highly scalable and available.
- Supports complex deployments and auto-healing.
- Suitable for enterprise environments.

### **Cons**
- Higher complexity and operational overhead.
- Requires Kubernetes knowledge.


## EKS Deployment Architecture for Kimai
The diagram represents a highly available and scalable architecture for deploying the Kimai application using AWS EKS.

### **Components Explained:**
- **VPC**: The entire infrastructure is deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for security and networking control.
- **Internet Gateway**: Allows public internet access for users interacting with the application.
- **Public Subnets**: Contains NAT Gateways to enable outbound internet access for private instances.
- **Private Subnets**: Houses the EKS cluster, keeping the Kimai application isolated from the public internet.
- **EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes cluster running the Kimai application in a managed environment.
- **Node Groups**: Consist of multiple worker nodes running in private subnets.
- **Kimai Deployment**: Runs within Kubernetes pods, ensuring scalability and availability.
- **AWS RDS (Master & Read Replica)**: Managed relational database for Kimai, ensuring data durability and read scalability.
- **Amazon EFS**: Provides shared storage across multiple pods and ensures persistent storage.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic to the Kimai service running in EKS.
- **Service (SVC)**: Manages internal communication between application pods and backend services.
- **Replication**: This is to make sure that we have HA setup in case if anything goes wrong with Master database, we can promote reader instance as master.

This architecture is suitable for **high availability, auto-scaling, and security**, making it production ready for application like Kimai.
